**Polls**, is a Discord Bot made for polls for your community and get feedback of them, with the help of Polls you can made it, creating normal polls of the type (yes or not), optionally make it temporally; same you can made multiple options polls, and yes... you can make it temporally same with a 28 days limit, you can get a good community feedback.

Actually Polls is developed by me (JeanCarlosVR) and i thanks you, if you can support me via **Patreon** (https://www.patreon.com/jeanvides) or **PayPay** (https://paypal.me/jeannvides), any donation is super thanked.

# How to setup yourself

You need to compile it running the command `tsc`, create a .env file, and put the below information (you can get a bot token in https://discord.com/developers/application and the Mongo URL in https://www.mongodb.com/); Next you need to run the 
command `npm run production`, and ready you have you own Polls bot.

I recommend use the [official version](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=663104539163099137&permissions=391232&scope=bot), for security and for support me.
